### Task-1 --> House Price Prediction

House price prediction involves developing a model that estimates the selling price of a house based on various factors such as its size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant features. This is typically done using machine learning algorithms that analyze historical housing data to identify patterns and relationships between the input features and the house prices. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of a new or unseen house based on its characteristics. House price prediction models are valuable tools in real estate for sellers, buyers, and investors to make informed decisions.




### Task-2 --> Iris Flower Classification


Iris Flower Classification is a machine learning task that involves identifying the species of iris flowers based on certain features. The dataset usually includes measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Commonly, a classification algorithm is trained on this data to learn patterns distinguishing three iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Once trained, the model can predict the species of an iris flower when provided with its feature measurements. The task is a classic example in machine learning and is often used for educational purposes and benchmarking algorithms.
